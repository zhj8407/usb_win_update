This tool is running on the USB host for verifing the firmware updating through
USB. It can support multi_platform.

1 Windows
The Visual Studio 2015 and Windows Driver Kit should be installed for compiling.
We can build them by either import the project using the IDE or from the command
line. This application depends on some other external libraries.
    a. AdbWinApi.dll and AdbWinUsbApi.dll
       Both of them come from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) with Apache
       License. They encapsulate the WinUSB API to implement the USB Read and Write
       functions. I also made some changes in them for supporting the USB Control
       Transfer. The source code has been placed outside in another folder.
    b. libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll
       These are the libraries of OpenSSL. I use them to calculate the MD5 Sum of
       the image file.

2. Linux
A Makefile is placed in directory "./usbdfu_linux". Typing "make" in the command
shell can generate the tool of Linux version.

To use it by non-root users, we need to copy the udev rules file
"./usbdfu_linux/51-plcmdevices.rules" to "/etc/udev/rules.d/". And then change the 
mode by "sudo chmod a+r /etc/udev/rules.d/51-plcmdevices.rules". Finally restart the
udev service by "service restart udev".

3. Mac OS X
A XCode project file is placed in directory "./usbdfu_osx". Open it by the XCode.
